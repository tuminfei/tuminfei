My name is Terry.Tu, nice to meet you!

Hello everyone! I'm a backend developer with over 10 years of experience in the field. I have spent the past 5 years focusing on web3 development, and it has been an exciting journey.

I have a deep passion for the crypto space and all things related to decentralized technologies. Working with blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (DApps) has been a thrilling experience for me. I am constantly exploring innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
